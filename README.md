# Say Hello

## Objectives

1. Build a method that can be called with an optional argument by defining that method with a default argument.

## Instructions

You will build a method called `say_hello`. This method should accept the argument of a person's name. It then should print `"Hello "` with the name followed by an exclamation point (don't forget that space after the "Hello"). For instance:

```ruby
# I call on the method, say_hello, and give it the string "Gabriela" 
say_hello("Gabriela")

# The method prints this text to the screen:
Hello Gabriela!
`
